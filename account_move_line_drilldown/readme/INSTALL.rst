To allow the user to browse through the first two levels of the chart of account
codes, this module adds two dedicated columns to the journal entry table to
store the first digit, and the first two digits of the journal entry account
code. The columns are populated automatically during the installation of the
module. The installation will take about 2 minutes for every million move lines
in your database.
